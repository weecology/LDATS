\title{Prepare the time chunk table for a multinomial change point 
  Time Series model}
\usage{
prep_chunks(data, changepoints = NULL, timename = "time")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Class \code{data.frame} object including the predictor and 
response variables, but specifically here containing the column indicated
by the \code{timename} input.}

\item{changepoints}{Numeric vector indicating locations of the change 
points. Must be conformable to \code{integer} values.}

\item{timename}{\code{character} element indicating the time variable
used in the time series. Defaults to \code{"time"}. The variable must be
integer-conformable or a \code{Date}. If the variable named
is a \code{Date}, the input is converted to an integer, resulting in the
timestep being 1 day, which is often not desired behavior.}
}
\value{
Data frame of \code{start} and \code{end} times for each chunk 
  (row).
}
\description{
Creates the table containing the start and end times for each
  chunk within a time series, based on the change points (used to break up
  the time series) and the range of the time series. If there are no 
  change points (i.e. \code{changepoints} is \code{NULL}, there is still a
  single chunk defined by the start and end of the time series.
